# Delay Destroyer
(Quaked) Latency Tweaks: The all-in-one lower latency tool. ðŸ˜Ž 

As many of y'all know most quote unquote 0 delay tricks do nothing, it's almost always bullshit. But there's real & legitimate methods, to get the lowest delay possible on your computer.

in combination with: 

(System Clock Settings) to properly configure timer res right.

(Priority Separation) to increase system responsiveness. 

(Timer Res & Global Res) to dramatically lower latency.

(Khorive's NDIS Network Tweaks) to Lower latency with the ndis driver.

(Calypto's Device Manger Tweaks) to turn off unnecessary devices. 

(Quaked Power Plan Section) to apply a power plan that has Processor Performance Time Check Interval set to max to dramatically reduce input delay.

Simply run [Latency Tweaks](https://github.com/QuakedK/Latency-Tweaks/releases/download/optimization/Quaked-Latency-Tweaks-V3.0.bat) as admin, and almost everything else is automatic, except user-required inputs.
